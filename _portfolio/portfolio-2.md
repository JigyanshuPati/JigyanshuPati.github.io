This project presents a hybrid research paper recommendation system that combines NLP techniques and graph-based algorithms. Using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings for semantic similarity and PageRank over a citation graph, the system suggests relevant papers based on a user-input abstract or keyword.

The system supports:
- Text preprocessing and vectorization (TF-IDF, BERT)
- Citation network construction and PageRank
- Query-based and content-based recommendations
- Evaluation against benchmark datasets like DBLP or ArXiv
