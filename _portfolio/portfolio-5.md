This project focuses on the mechanical design and kinematic optimization of a garage door system using a four-bar linkage. The goal was to ensure smooth motion, minimize the swept area, and reduce torque requirements.

**Key Features:**
- Designed the four-bar linkage mechanism in SolidWorks
- Performed dynamic and kinematic analysis using MATLAB
- Optimized linkage configuration for efficient space utilization
- Minimized coupler linkâ€™s swept area and reduced required torque
- Ensured structural integrity while improving energy efficiency
