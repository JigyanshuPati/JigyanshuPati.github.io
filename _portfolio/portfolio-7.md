title: "Phishing URL Detection using Multi-input LSTM"
excerpt: "Developed a deep learning pipeline to classify URLs as benign or phishing by combining character-level LSTM sequences with engineered URL features like abnormal character counts.<br/><img src='/images/phishing_url_demo.png'>"

This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using a multi-input LSTM model that processes both URL character sequences and engineered numeric features such as the count of suspicious characters, inspired by cybersecurity threat detection techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Used a public malicious URL dataset from Kaggle
- Extracted URL features including suspicious character counts (`abnormal_url`)
- Applied character-level tokenization and sequence padding for URLs
- Built a multi-input Keras model combining LSTM and dense layers for classification
- Developed a Flask API for real-time URL phishing detection
- Achieved promising accuracy with interpretable feature integration
- Demonstrated practical deployment with API response screenshots
