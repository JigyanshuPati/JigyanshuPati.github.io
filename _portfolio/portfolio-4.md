This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Falknerâ€“Skan boundary layer problemâ€”a classical fluid dynamics case governed by Reynolds-Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) equations.

**Key Features:**
- Neural network model incorporates physical laws as soft constraints
- Learned velocity and pressure profiles in boundary layers with high accuracy
- Achieved errors: U = 0.082%, V = 0.147%, P = 0.021%
- Compared results with OpenFOAM to validate PINN predictions
- Eliminated the need for mesh refinement, reducing computational overhead
