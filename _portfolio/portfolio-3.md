This project involves the modeling and simulation of a 3-DoF robotic arm using SolidWorks and MATLAB. The system uses Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters to define link configuration and performs both forward and inverse kinematics computations.

**Key Features:**
- 3D robotic arm designed in SolidWorks with joint constraints  
- Forward and inverse kinematics implemented in MATLAB  
- Achieved a mean tracking error of less than 0.5 mm for trajectory paths  
- Integrated MATLAB with SolidWorks to validate motion in real-time
