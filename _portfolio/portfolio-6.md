This project focuses on the detection and classification of bearing faults using machine learning techniques applied to vibration signal data, inspired by predictive maintenance in rotating machinery.

**Key Features:**
- Used the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset
- Performed signal preprocessing using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Extracted statistical and spectral features from the vibration data
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers: SVM, Random Forest, k-NN
- Achieved classification accuracy over 95% in distinguishing fault types
- Visualized performance using confusion matrix and feature importance analysis
